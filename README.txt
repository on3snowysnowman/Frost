# Frost ( Simple Text and 2D Image Engine ) by Joel Height #

Frost is a lightweight 2D engine designed for rendering text and PNG images. It contains various 
tools for creating simple text menus along with support for sprite rendering. Uses 
SDL2 (Simple Direct Media Layer) as the foundation for rendering pngs on the screen, as well as 
handling events such as keyboard presses.
