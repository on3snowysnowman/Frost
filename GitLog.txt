This file tracks specific details on what was changed each git push.

11:

   - Fixed naming in TimeObserver.
 
   - Added typedef to TimeObserver for ease of access to chrono time points.
 
   - Added a "Redesigns" folder for classes that are being redesigned/overhauled but can't be 
     integrated into the engine yet, due to naming conflicts.

   - Fixed typo(s) in documentation.


10:

   - Added high precision timing to TimeObserver using chrono.


9: 

   - Fixed bug in ConsoleOutputHandler's move_cursor and move_cursor_y where it was setting the
     first cursor's position to 0, not the second.

   - Added a Component class. 


8:

   - Began work on a Tilemap architecture. 

   - Fixed issue with UIDisplayTools meter methods not properly calculating meter numbers.

   - Removed some unused variables.

   - Removed several redundant allocations of vector and unordered_map on the heap. 

   - Began work on an EventSystem

   - Configured cmake to automatically find and compile src files rather than directly declaring 
     them.


7 :

   - Fixed documentation of TextFileHandler::fetch(), along with a invalid nullptr return in its 
     implementation.

6 :

   - Reconfigured text font files to use ints to resemble characters rather than strings, also 
     reconfigured the way TextRenderingHandler reads them.

   - Added a new font, "Other_Font". Most likely will become the default one, looks much nicer
     than my custom made one. 

   - Changed the default vertical space modifier for the ConsoleOutputHandler to be 1.0f, since
     the new font supplies space vertically between characters.

5 :

   - Fixed typos in README.txt

   - Fixed bug in color constructor when initializing color name. 

   - Added documentation for FrostRandom.

   - Updated documentation for TextFileHandler.hpp

4 :

   - Added a FrostRandom class under Fr_Random for getting random numbers.

   - Added get_anchor() method to ConsoleOutputHandler.

   - Reconfigured the way cmake installs to the disk and handles building.

   - Added UIButton. UISimulation should now be fully functional.


3 :
   
   - Finished UISimulationTools.

   - Created a shell script for automatic building on arch linux.

   - Fixed bug in MenuManager where a wierd issue was happening with a const Menu*.


2 : 

   - Began work on UISimulationTools.

   - Added set_anchor_here to ConsoleOutputHandler.

   - Finished UITextList, and started work on UIList.

   - Added is_even to Fr_Math.

   - Removed redundant block in JsonHandler::dump that created a file if it didn't exist, which is
     done automatically anyways by std::fstream.

   - Removed typo in UIChoice::m_selected_index's description.

1 :

    - Began work on a UITextList class.

    - Added a UIChoice class. 

    - Reconfigured UIVariable into three distinct classes, UIStringVariable UIIntVariable and 
      UIFloatVariable. This will remove all type checking logic that had to exist in the original
      UIVariable, since now there is a class for each specific type.

0 : 
    - Added GitLog.txt.
    - Finished UIVariable. 
    - Added a new method for handling ctrl-backspace behavior in Fr_StringManip.
