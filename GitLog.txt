    - Began work on a UITextList class.

    - Added a UIChoice class. 

    - Reconfigured UIVariable into three distinct classes, UIStringVariable UIIntVariable and 
      UIFloatVariable. This will remove all type checking logic that had to exist in the original
      UIVariable, since now there is a class for each specific type.
