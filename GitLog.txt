This file tracks specific details on what was changed each git push.


6 :

   - Reconfigured text font files to use ints to resemble characters rather than strings, also 
     reconfigured the way TextRenderingHandler reads them.

   - Added a new font, "Other_Font". Most likely will become the default one, looks much nicer
     than my custom made one. 

   - Changed the default vertical space modifier for the ConsoleOutputHandler to be 1.0f, since
     the new font supplies space vertically between characters.

5 :

   - Fixed typos in README.txt

   - Fixed bug in color constructor when initializing color name. 

   - Added documentation for FrostRandom.

   - Updated documentation for TextFileHandler.hpp

4 :

   - Added a FrostRandom class under Fr_Random for getting random numbers.

   - Added get_anchor() method to ConsoleOutputHandler.

   - Reconfigured the way cmake installs to the disk and handles building.

   - Added UIButton. UISimulation should now be fully functional.


3 :
   
   - Finished UISimulationTools.

   - Created a shell script for automatic building on arch linux.

   - Fixed bug in MenuManager where a wierd issue was happening with a const Menu*.


2 : 

   - Began work on UISimulationTools.

   - Added set_anchor_here to ConsoleOutputHandler.

   - Finished UITextList, and started work on UIList.

   - Added is_even to Fr_Math.

   - Removed redundant block in JsonHandler::dump that created a file if it didn't exist, which is
     done automatically anyways by std::fstream.

   - Removed typo in UIChoice::m_selected_index's description.

1 :

    - Began work on a UITextList class.

    - Added a UIChoice class. 

    - Reconfigured UIVariable into three distinct classes, UIStringVariable UIIntVariable and 
      UIFloatVariable. This will remove all type checking logic that had to exist in the original
      UIVariable, since now there is a class for each specific type.

0 : 
    - Added GitLog.txt.
    - Finished UIVariable. 
    - Added a new method for handling ctrl-backspace behavior in Fr_StringManip.
