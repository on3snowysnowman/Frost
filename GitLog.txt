   - Began work on UISimulationTools

   - Added set_anchor_here to ConsoleOutputHandler.

   - Finished UITextList, and started work on UIList.

   - Added is_even to Fr_Math.

   - Removed redundant block in JsonHandler::dump that created a file if it didn't exist, which is
     done automatically anyways by std::fstream.

1 :

    - Began work on a UITextList class.

    - Added a UIChoice class. 

    - Reconfigured UIVariable into three distinct classes, UIStringVariable UIIntVariable and 
      UIFloatVariable. This will remove all type checking logic that had to exist in the original
      UIVariable, since now there is a class for each specific type.

    - Finished UIVariable.
